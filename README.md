# TechLabs_Web_Dev_Exam
Final exam for our TechLabs Barcelona batch in 2020üå¥.

## Why exam?
In order to assess your progress, we have prepared a challenge for you. Now, the main reason for having this is that we can't assess your progress solely based on the analytical tools we have since those are easy to cheat on. Moreover, this year some of our projects will be of professional nature. We are currently finalizing some of the contracts and are looking for capable people to deliver.

## Synopsis
Let me explain the parts of the exam. First of all, you will have a final decision of choosing to complete either an easier version or a more complicated one involving some development with react. Good news is that by passing the easier version of the challenge, you will continue to be part of TechLabs and will be able to complete a project with your other teammates. However, **when deciding on the people for a professional project for a company, we will give preference to the candidates who have completed the tougher version**. Therefore, for those of you who want to secure a position for a **professional WebDev project for a client you SHOULD complete the second version**. As a final reminder, in **none of the cases** should you do both versions. The final deliverable expected from either of the versions is a working website hosted on Github pages or any other platform such as Herokuapp or even a customized URL **+** your Github repository with the code used. **In case you have used platforms like Wix for development you will be instantly out of TechLabs**.

## Easier Version 
This consists of creating a **one-pager landing page**. The main focus of our evaluation will be on the UX/UI of your website. Therefore, you will have to show a proficiency with CSS and HTML. For those of you wanting to have more fun, we also welcome experimental design, so don't fear to open your mind to new ideasüß†. Here are a couple of ideas for your landing page:
- Your own portfolio website.
- Redesign of any website's main page.
- Anything of your imagination including your hobbies, virtual worlds, etc. 
If the implementation is extremely good, having used good storytelling, meaningful UX and UI, you will still have chances of getting the professional project afterwards with a focus on Front-End and UX/UI. So, for those of you choosing this challenge, I would strongly recommend spending a lot of time on your design and other things previously mentioned. 

## Harder Version

Quick note: if you are unsure of your React knowledge or haven't even started with our React course, we would strongly recommend you **NOT to do this version of the exam**.

Consists of implementing the concepts learnt in React course by **creating a Search App** from scratch. Since the course didn't cover everything, we expect you to use the online community to find anything else you need. Here are the essential features we expect to see from you:
- It's a one pager that consists of a search bar, a list of elements and the name + info/image of the selected element.
- When a user types a query, the list of elements should display the 10 first results (can be an API return or anything else).
- When a user clicks on an element from the list, it should appear on the main scene on the left.
- We still expect good quality UI and Front-End, however, this is not as important as in the first challenge.


Below you can see one of the possibilities to implement this challenge, yours doesn't have to be the same.
